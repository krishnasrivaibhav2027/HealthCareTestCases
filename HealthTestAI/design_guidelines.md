# Design Guidelines: AI-Powered Healthcare Test Case Generation Platform

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach:** Design System (Material Design + Healthcare Enterprise)
**Justification:** This is a utility-focused, information-dense enterprise application requiring consistency, accessibility, and professional credibility in the healthcare domain.

## Design Principles
- **Clinical Precision:** Clean, structured layouts that reflect healthcare's attention to detail
- **Enterprise Reliability:** Professional, trustworthy interface suitable for regulated environments
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Minimize complexity in dense information displays
- **Compliance Confidence:** Visual indicators that reinforce regulatory adherence

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light Mode: 220 85% 25% (Deep healthcare blue)
- Dark Mode: 220 60% 85% (Light blue for contrast)

**Secondary/Surface Colors:**
- Light backgrounds: 220 15% 98%
- Dark backgrounds: 220 15% 8%
- Cards/surfaces: Subtle elevation with appropriate contrast

**Status Colors:**
- Success (compliance): 145 70% 35%
- Warning (review needed): 35 85% 55%
- Error (non-compliant): 0 75% 50%
- Info (AI-generated): 210 80% 60%

### B. Typography
**Font Stack:** Inter (Google Fonts) for excellent readability in data-dense contexts
- **Headings:** 600-700 weight, clear hierarchy (32px, 24px, 20px, 16px)
- **Body Text:** 400-500 weight, 16px base with 1.5 line height
- **Code/Technical:** JetBrains Mono for requirement IDs and technical specifications

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind scale focused on 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- **Component Spacing:** p-4, p-6 for cards and containers
- **Section Spacing:** mb-8, mb-12 for major sections
- **Grid Gaps:** gap-4, gap-6 for consistent layouts

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation bar with logo, main sections, and user profile
- Sidebar for secondary navigation (requirements, test cases, compliance)
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies

**Data Displays:**
- Clean tables with alternating row colors, sorting, and filtering
- Requirement cards with status indicators and action buttons
- Traceability matrix with visual connection lines
- Compliance dashboard with progress indicators

**Forms & Interactions:**
- Chat interface with message bubbles (user vs AI distinction)
- Modal dialogs for test case generation and editing
- Dropdown menus for filtering and sorting
- Toggle switches for compliance standards

**Enterprise Elements:**
- Status badges for compliance levels
- Progress bars for generation status
- Export buttons with format options
- Audit trail timestamps and user attribution

### E. Specific Healthcare/Enterprise Considerations

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Clear distinction between requirements, generated tests, and compliance status
- Prominent placement of compliance indicators and traceability links
- Logical grouping of related functions (generate → review → export)

**Trust Indicators:**
- Subtle logos/badges for compliance standards (FDA, ISO)
- Clear attribution for AI-generated vs human-modified content
- Version control indicators and audit trail visibility

**Information Density Management:**
- Collapsible sections for detailed compliance information
- Progressive disclosure in test case generation flows
- Summary views with drill-down capabilities

## Key Interface Areas

**Dashboard:** Clean metrics overview with quick access to recent requirements and pending reviews

**Requirements Table:** Sortable, filterable display with clear status indicators and prominent "Generate Test Cases" actions

**AI Chat Interface:** Conversational design with clear message attribution, regeneration options, and export controls

**Compliance Matrix:** Visual representation of requirement-to-test traceability with coverage analytics

**Export Workflows:** Simple, guided process for multiple format outputs with preview capabilities

This design approach ensures the platform feels both modern and appropriate for the high-stakes healthcare software development environment while maintaining the efficiency needed for enterprise QA workflows.
